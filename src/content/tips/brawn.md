name: "Brawn"
description: "Brawn was on our list of restaurants to try for a long time. It's located on Columbia Road and hardly noticeable on the busy market days during the weekend. The menu is Mediterranean inspired. All the food was really excellent. The only minus is, they mostly serve natural wines, which we didn't enjoy that much and we'll probably skip the wines all together next time. "
