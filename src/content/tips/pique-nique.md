name: "Pique Nique"
description: "A lovely French restaurant in Bermondsey. It’s in an unexpected location in the corner of a small park. The food, staff and atmosphere are all very French. I love the saddle of lamb as well as their mille-feuille desserts! The menu changes depending on the season, and it’s always excellent quality."
