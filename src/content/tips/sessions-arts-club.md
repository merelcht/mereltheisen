name: "Sessions Arts Club"
description: "This is probably one of the coolest places on my list. It's hard to get a table (set an alarm for when bookings are opened!), but totally worth the effort. The restaurant is located in an 18th century building and looks fantastic. The menu changes frequently and can be described as modern european. The cocktails are great too. Definitely a good place to go for a special occasion or if you want to impress someone!"
