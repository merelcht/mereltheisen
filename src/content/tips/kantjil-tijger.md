name: "Kantjil & De Tijger"
description: "I highly recommend trying some Dutch Indonesian food when you’re visiting Amsterdam. Kantjil & de Tiger is an excellent restaurant to do this, located in the city centre. Go for the classic rijsttafel which consists of many side dishes served in small portions, accompanied by rice prepared in several different ways."
