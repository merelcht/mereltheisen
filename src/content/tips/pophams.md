name: "Pophams"
description: "Pophams is a bakery during the day, pasta restaurant at night and I can recommend it for both. At Pophams they do pastries with a twist: danishes with figs or peaces and savoury versions with rosemary, olives, cheese and the likes. Expect queues on the weekend when all of east London is out and about for brunch, but again worth the wait. "
