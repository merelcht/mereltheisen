name: "Bob Bob Ricard (Soho)"
description: "Press here for champagne! Every table has a button to call the waiters for more champagne. Bob Bob Ricard is apparently one of the few places in London where the capped the mark-up on fine wine at £75. It’s a fancy place, perfect for date nights or other special occasions. They serve Russian French food, which is truly delicious. My favourite is the salmon en croute in champagne sauce."
