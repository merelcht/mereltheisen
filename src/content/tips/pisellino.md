name: "Bar Pisellino"
description: "Bar Pisellino is a fantastic all-day Italian style bar. They serve coffees and small bites and later in the day cocktails as well. It's a small place and you can't book a table, but you usually get a spot with little waiting. I wish there were more places like bar Pisellino!"
