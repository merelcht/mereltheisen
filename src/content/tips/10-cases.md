name: "The 10 Cases"
description: "The 10 Cases is a fantastic french mediterranean wine bar. They only ever buy ten cases of each wine, so there's always
something new to try. The menu also changes frequently. It's the perfect place for a quick bite before going to the theater or spending a long summer evening on their terrace. I'm also a big fan of their sister restaurants Parsons and Baudry Greene."
