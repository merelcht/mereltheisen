name: "Relais de Venise"
description: "Relais de Venise is a chain of restaurants across London, Paris and various other cities. Their formula is very easy: they serve steak frites and a salad to start. You can choose from a selection of French wine, cheese, and freshly in-house made desserts. The London branches are usually quite busy, especially in the evening, but turn-over is high as well so the wait isn’t too long. "
