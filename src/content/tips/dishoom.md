name: "Dishoom"
description: "Dishoom is probably the restaurant I've been to most in London. This is because the food is fantastic and it's a great place to go with any group size. Portions are large enough to share and there's something for everyone! It's also a great place to try Indian food if you're not used to it, because they have a lot of dishes with only mild spice levels. The only downside of going to Dishoom is that you'll likely have to queue for a long time. But they've optimised the queueing experience by offering drinks while you wait, and honestly it's 100% worth it! "
