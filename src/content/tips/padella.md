name: "Padella"
description: "At Padella you can expect fresh pasta with varying sauces. The portions are relatively small, so you can try a couple of pastas, which is especially great if you go with a group. The wait for a table can be long and at some locations they operate a virtual queue, so you can go for a walk or get a drink nearby while you wait."
