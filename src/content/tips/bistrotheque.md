name: "Bistrotheque"
description: "This is by far my favourite brunch place in London. The restaurant is located in what looks like an old industrial building. It doesn’t look very special from the outside, but on the inside it has lots of character. It’s always very light, because of the big windows and the tables covered with tablecloths and grand piano in the corner give it a very chique feel. They serve classic brunch dishes, with eggs and toast, but always with an unexpected twist."
