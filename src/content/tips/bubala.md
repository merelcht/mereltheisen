name: "Bubala"
description: "This is probably my favourite restaurant food wise. The food can be described as experimental Middle Eastern. Everything is vegetarian or vegan and so incredibly delicious! It’s hard to stop eating and I can promise you will always leave with a full tummy, because the food just keeps coming. The restaurants have a nice atmosphere, but are a tiny bit on the crammed side. You need to book well in advance."
