name: "Joia"
description: "Joia really pleasantly surprised me. The interior is very trendy, all milenium pink, and views all around. It's pricey, but the food is really excellent. The menu is influencec by Portugese and Catalonion cuisine and you can really notice the skill of the chefs in the preparation of the food. Added bonus is the view you get on Battersea Power Station."
